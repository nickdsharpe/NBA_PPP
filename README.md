# NBA Points Per Possesion

In this project I hand-track NBA possession data by play type, and calculate players and teams points per possession (PPP) on those plays. Given the data I collect, I can also calculate a number of other inisightful data points such as:
- Percentage of play type (how frequently a player or team runs a certain play)
- Field goal %, 2pt field goal %, and 3pt field goal % by play type and overall
- PPP on shooting and passing possessions
- Differences in % of play type, and all field goal percentages in shooting and passing possessions
